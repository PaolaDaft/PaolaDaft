### Hi there. Welcome to my profile <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/mona-whisper.gif" width="40px">
Hello! 😊 My name is Pao, and I love meeting new people. I enjoy attending in-person and virtual events within the tech community and participating in hackathons 👩🏽‍💻✨. Currently, I'm very interested in the world of data, so I'm always taking courses in that area. I also like dancing, especially salsa and cumbia 💃.
